I'm a college student at Binghamton University who is learning how to code with Python and Visual Studio Code. I have recently been learning about APIs and Web Scraping. It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. Hopefully in the future I can take my skills and try to learn another programming language. 


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python, and VSC.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on web scraping for my final project. 
- ðŸ˜€ I like to play soccer, code, watch movies, and make TikTok videos in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about women's college soccer.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have one less tooth in my top row but it's not noticeable
